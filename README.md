### Hi, I'm Erin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist. I specialized in bioinformatics and molecular biology for my bachelor's degree and I studied adult stem cells in the prostate epithelium for my PhD at the University of Chicago. <br><br>Now, as a federal contractor, I help the CDC and others implement bioinformatics pipelines for processing, analyzing, and managing their next-generation sequencing data. I've become much more interested in how to architect private AI systems via privacy-preserving data-mining (PPDM) techniques (e.g., federated learning, differential privacy) for the biomedical research community.<br>

<b>Current Focus</b>: Machine learning -- how to deploy private, transparent, and ethical analytics for use with biomedical data.<br>
<b>Current Learning</b>: <a href="https://courses.openmined.org/courses/foundations-of-private-computation">Foundations of Private Computation</a>
