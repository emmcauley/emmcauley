### Hi, I'm Erin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist. I specialized in bioinformatics and molecular biology for my bachelor's degree and I studied adult epithelial stem cells during my PhD at the University of Chicago. I'm currently a Senior Bioinformatics Scientist at Fulcrum Genomics and I write code to help scientists do cool things.<br>
