### Hi, I'm Erin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a scientist. I specialized in bioinformatics and molecular biology for my bachelor's degree and I studied adult stem cells in the prostate epithelium during my PhD at the University of Chicago. Recently I've become interested in how to architect private AI systems via privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) like federated learning and differential privacy for the biomedical research community.<br>
